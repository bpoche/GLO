PTU_ebay unit having problems during calibration. 
At the end of each sweep, it gets hung sometimes and does not make
it all the way back to the left of the page. Then on each new sweep
it doesn't move the full 8 positions for the first few commands.
Not really sure why this is, but will try to just use a different 
range of the pan axis for calibration.
